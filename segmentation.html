									          <b>Multi-class segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy images</b>. 
									          We consider the simultaneous segmentation of two structures using the <a href="publications.html#PR2014">PI-Boost</a>, namely, 
									          synapses with mitochondria, and mitochondra with membranes. To this end we select three image stacks encompassing different SBFEM 
									          acquisition technologies and image resolutions. We introduce both a new Boosting algorithm to perform feature scale selection and the
									          <i>Jaccard Curve</i> as a tool compare several segmentation results. We then experimentally study the gains in performance obtained 
									          when simultaneously segmenting two structures with properly selected image descriptor scales. The results show that by doing so we 
									          achieve significant gains in segmentation accuracy when compared to the best results in the literature using boosting algorithms.
									          <br>
									          Simultaneously segmenting several neuronal structures described at different scales provides voxel classification algorithms with 
									          highly discriminating features that significantly improve segmentation accuracy.

									          <b>Feature descriptors for Mitochondria and Synapse Segmentation</b>.<br>
									          Full understanding of the architecture of the brain is a long term goal 
									          of neuroscience. To achieve it, advanced image processing tools are required, 
									          that automate the the analysis and reconstruction of brain structures. Synapses 
									          and mitochondria are two prominent structures with neurological interest for 
									          which various automated image segmentation approaches have been recently proposed. 
									          In this work we present a comparative study of several image feature descriptors 
									          used for the segmentation of synapses and mitochondria in stacks of electron 
									          microscopy images.

									          <b>Non-parametric Higher-Order Random Fields for Image Segmentation</b>.
									          Models defined using higher-order potentials are becoming
									          increasingly popular in computer vision. However, the exact representation 
									          of a general higher-order potential defined over many variables is
									          computationally unfeasible. This has led prior works to adopt parametric 
									          potentials that can be compactly represented. In this work we proposed a
									          non-parametric higher-order model for image labeling problems that uses
									          a patch-based representation of its potentials. We use a known transformation
									          scheme to convert the higher-order potentials to a pair-wise
									          form that can be handled using traditional inference algorithms. This
									          representation is able to capture structure, geometrical and topological
									          information of labels from training data and to provide more precise 
									          segmentations. Other tasks such as image denoising and reconstruction are
									          also possible. We evaluate our method on denoising and segmentation problems 
									          with synthetic and real images.

									          <b>A morphological approach to curvature-based evolution of curves and surfaces</b>.<br>
									          We introduce new results connecting differential and morphological operators that 
									          provide a formal and theoretically grounded approach for stable and fast contour 
									          evolution. Contour evolution algorithms have been extensively used for boundary 
									          detection and tracking in computer vision. The standard solution based on partial 
									          differential equations and level-sets requires the use of numerical methods of integration 
									          that are costly computationally and may have stability issues. We present a morphological
									          approach to contour evolution based on a new curvature morphological operator valid for 
									          surfaces of any dimension. We approximate the numerical solution of the curve evolution 
									          PDE by the successive application of a set of morphological operators defined on a binary 
									          level-set and with equivalent infinitesimal behavior. These operators are very fast, do 
									          not suffer numerical stability issues and do not degrade the level set function, so there 
									          is no need of re-initializing it. Moreover, their implementation is much easier since they do
									          not require the use of sophisticated numerical algorithms. We validate the approach providing 
									          a morphological implementation of the Geodesic Active Contours, the Active Contours Without 
									          Borders and Turpopixels. In the experiments conducted the morphological implementations 
									          converge to solutions equivalent to those achieved by traditional numerical solutions, but 
									          with significant gains in simplicity, speed and stability.
